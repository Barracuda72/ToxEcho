Tox echo bot
============

Simpliest program using [toxcore](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore).
It connects to Tox, accepts any friendship request and returns received
messages to user.

List of DHT nodes to bootstrap (file `nodes`) comes from
[Toxic source](https://github.com/Tox/toxic/blob/master/misc/DHTnodes).
